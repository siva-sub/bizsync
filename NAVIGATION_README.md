## Future Enhancements

1. **Search Integration** - Global search across all modules
2. **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Desktop keyboard navigation
3. **Custom Workflows** - User-defined business workflows
4. **Deep Linking** - URL-based navigation for web deployment
5. **Breadcrumb Navigation** - Better navigation hierarchy display
6. **Tab Management** - Multiple tabs for power users

## Testing Navigation

The navigation system can be tested by:

1. **Run the app**: `flutter run`
2. **Test responsive behavior**: Resize window to test desktop/mobile modes
3. **Test navigation flows**: Try navigating between different modules
4. **Test quick actions**: Use quick action menus and shortcuts
5. **Test integration points**: Create invoices and see payment integration

## Notes

- All navigation routes are defined in `app_router.dart`
- Wrapper classes are used for screens that haven't been fully integrated yet
- The navigation service provides a consistent API for all navigation needs
- Integration service demonstrates how modules can work together
- The system is designed to be easily extendable for future modules

This navigation system provides a solid foundation for the BizSync app, making it feel like a complete, integrated business management solution rather than separate, disconnected features.
