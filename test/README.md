## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Integration

The test suite is designed to work with CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
name: Test Suite
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
      - run: flutter pub get
      - run: flutter test --coverage
      - run: flutter test test/integration/ --timeout=5m
      - run: flutter test test/performance/ --timeout=10m
```

### Test Reports

Automated test reporting includes:
- Coverage reports
- Performance metrics
- Test execution time
- Failure analysis
- Memory usage statistics

## Best Practices

### Test Structure

1. **Arrange-Act-Assert** pattern consistently used
2. **Given-When-Then** structure for integration tests
3. **Setup-Execute-Teardown** for resource management
4. **Mock-Test-Verify** for service testing

### Test Isolation

- Each test is independent
- Proper setup and teardown
- No shared state between tests
- Database reset between tests

### Performance Considerations

- Tests run within acceptable time limits
- Memory usage is monitored
- Large datasets are handled efficiently
- Concurrent operations are tested

### Error Handling

- All error scenarios are tested
- Recovery mechanisms are validated
- Timeout handling is implemented
- Resource cleanup is guaranteed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Test Timeouts
```bash
# Increase timeout for slow tests
flutter test --timeout=5m test/integration/
```

#### Memory Issues
```bash
# Run tests with increased memory
flutter test --vm-options="--old_gen_heap_size=4096"
```

#### Database Locks
```bash
# Ensure proper database cleanup
# Check test_config.dart for reset logic
```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug output for test debugging:

```dart
// In test files
debugPrint('Test checkpoint: ${DateTime.now()}');

// Enable verbose logging
TestConfig.enableVerboseLogging = true;
```

## Coverage Requirements

### Minimum Coverage Targets

- **Overall Coverage**: > 80%
- **Unit Tests**: > 90%
- **Widget Tests**: > 85%
- **Integration Tests**: > 75%
- **Critical Paths**: 100%

### Coverage Exclusions

Files excluded from coverage requirements:
- Generated files (*.g.dart)
- Test files themselves
- Mock implementations
- Platform-specific stub files
